            I grew up in Zarqa-Jordan. I studied Computer Science at Al-Hussein Bin Talal University. My senior project was android Application with many features that aimed to facilitate users' life.
            And to complete the graduation requirements, I trained in the Directorate of Education- Zarqa II in maintenance and networking field. <br/>
            After graduation I've interned in front-end web development with Clever Mind POB ICT.
            I did not get a real job opportunity yet, and I hope that this program, along with ASAC, will provide me with knowledge in software development that will qualify me for a job.
