It was great, creating a project with my own and practicing is the best way to understand the class.  
   
2. What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?  
  
At first i faced a problem that i wrote this code on my local before creating a new repository on GitHub, i don't know if i forgot this again, Is there any solution instead of creating repo with it's file and copy the code again?  
  
3. How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
